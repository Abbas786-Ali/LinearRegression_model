# LinearRegression_model
> **Certainly:**

This project demonstrates a basic linear regression model to predict tip amounts based on the total bill.
Here's a breakdown of the steps performed:

> **Import Libraries:**

 
 Essential libraries like pandas for data manipulation,
 numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization,and LinearRegression from scikit-learn for model building were imported.
 
> **Load Data:**

 The 'tips' dataset was loaded from seaborn, providing information about restaurant bills, tips, and other related factors.
 
> **Visualize Data:**

 A regression plot was created using seaborn.regplot to visualize the relationship between 'total_bill' (independent variable) and 'tip' (dependent variable).
 
> **Train Model:**

 A LinearRegression model was initialized and trained using the 'total_bill' as the feature (X) and 'tip' as the target (Y).

> **Make Predictions:**

 Finally, the trained model was used to predict tip amounts for new 'total_bill' values (specifically 50 and 100).
